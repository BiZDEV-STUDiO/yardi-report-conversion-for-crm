# yardi-report-conversion-for-crm
This is a collection of google scripts we compiled that will import Yardi Reports from a Google Drive folder and them convert them in to a mapped csv file that is then exported and emailed.

For a visual flowchart illustrating the functionality of this spreadsheet app, visit https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1A0GlP2wBGED1raGCtj_FH2IoAya-JiIDzzQEp6d-V1I/edit?usp=sharing

If you are a property manager using Yardi for your accounting and Business Catalyst for your marketing and you would like a copy of the spreadsheet app, feel free to reach out to me on my twitter handle: @Gregg_C__
